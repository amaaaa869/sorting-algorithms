various sorting and searching algorithms, along with a relatively basic code exerpt, made by yours truly. the only way to properly run the code 
is to copy and paste into either VisualStudio (which i don't know how to use) or Replit (which is much simpler in my opinion).  

the code runs and is free of basic bugs. let me know if you find anything that can be changed.
